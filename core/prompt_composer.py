"""
novus_v3/core/prompt_composer.py — Dynamic Prompt Composition

Replaces hardcoded system prompts with a modular system where:
  1. CORE modules load for every agent
  2. SECTOR modules load based on the company's sector
  3. SIGNAL modules load based on what the extraction pipeline found
  4. AGENT modules load based on which agent is running

Each module is a versioned, testable text block.
Analysts can edit modules without touching Python code.
